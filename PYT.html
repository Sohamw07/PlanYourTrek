            </h1>
            <p style="color:black"class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A trek to the Rajmachi Fort will take you to the hidden landscapes of the region that will spellbind you. The Fort was built back in the 17th century and is one of the best trekking spots of Maharashtra. It is snuggled in the Karjat region and was built in the era of Shivaji Maharaj. From here, you can take a look at the Borghat which is a historic trade route and extends spectacular views. Apart from this, it is one of the best places to visit in Khandala.
                The best time to visit Rajmachi Fort is between the months of June- September when monsoon sets in full swing and the entire region takes on a mystic charm being drenched in rain.
                During trek mobile connectivity is very poor and you can expect hardly any network to make any call. Sometimes there is strong signal for sending messages or making calls. But sometimes the connection vanishes away. So, it is recommended that you should make urgent calls or send important messages as soon as you receive the signals.</p>

              <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">Mahad,MH
            </h1>
            <p style="color:black"class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Raigad Fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and the chief engineer was Hiroji Indulkar. The main palace was constructed using wood, of which only the base pillars remain. The main fort ruins consist of the queen's quarters, six chambers, with each chamber having its own private restroom. However, an interesting observation is that the chambers do not have any window, which may suggest they could have been used as store-rooms to store valuables and personal belongings of the queens. In addition, ruins of three watch towers can be seen directly in front of the palace grounds out of which only two remain as the third one was destroyed during a bombardment. The Raigad Fort also has ruins of a market which was accessible to horseback riders, although they could also have been guest houses for important visitors due to their internal structure and close proximity to the court. The fort also overlooks an artificial lake known as the Ganga Sagar Lake

                The only main pathway to the fort passes through the "Maha Darwaja" (Huge Door) which was previously closed at sunset. The Maha Darwaja has two huge bastions on both sides of the door which are approximately 65–70 feet in height. The top of the fort is 600 ft above this door.</p>
